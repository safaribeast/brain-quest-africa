# Contributing to Brain Quest Africa

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Brain Quest Africa as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Development Process
We use Github Flow, so all code changes happen through pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env.local` file with required environment variables (see README.md).

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### CSS/Tailwind
- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Follow mobile-first approach
- Keep styling consistent
- Use CSS modules for component-specific styles

### Components
- Keep components small and reusable
- Use proper TypeScript types
- Add prop validation
- Include component documentation

## Testing
- Write unit tests for utilities
- Add integration tests for components
- Test edge cases
- Maintain test coverage

## Documentation
- Update README.md with new features
- Document complex functions
- Add JSDoc comments
- Keep API documentation current

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/safaribeast/brain-quest-africa/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/safaribeast/brain-quest-africa/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
